## Project Overview

QuantumPay is a blockchain-based payment network designed to provide ultra-fast, secure, and scalable digital transactions. The project encompasses core algorithms, smart contracts, and protocols that power the payment infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To get started with QuantumPay development, you will need:

- A basic understanding of blockchain technology and smart contracts.
- Familiarity with programming languages used in the project (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Solidity).
- A development environment set up on your local machine.

## Development Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/QuantumPay-Core.git
   cd QuantumPay-Core
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the necessary environment variables. You can refer to the `.env.example` file for guidance.

## Code Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the QuantumPay Network.
  - `core/`: Core functionalities including blockchain, transactions, consensus, and security.
  - `smart-contracts/`: Smart contracts for various functionalities.
  - `ai-optimization/`: AI algorithms for transaction optimization.
  - `interoperability/`: Modules for cross-chain communication.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.

- `tests/`: Contains unit, integration, and performance tests.

- `scripts/`: Deployment and management scripts.

## Building the Project

To build the project, run the following command in the root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile the source code and prepare it for deployment.

## Running Tests

To ensure the integrity of the code, run the test suite using:

```bash
npm test
```

You can also run specific tests by specifying the test file:

```bash
npm test path/to/test-file.js
```
