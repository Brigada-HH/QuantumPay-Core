# QuantumPay API Authentication Methods

This document outlines the authentication methods and protocols used to secure access to the QuantumPay API. Proper authentication is essential to ensure that only authorized users can interact with the API and perform sensitive operations.

## Overview

The QuantumPay API uses token-based authentication to secure its endpoints. Users must authenticate themselves to obtain an access token, which is then used to authorize subsequent API requests.

## Authentication Flow

1. **User Registration**: Users must first create an account by providing their username, password, and email address. Upon successful registration, a user ID is generated.

2. **User Login**: After registration, users can log in to obtain an access token. The login process involves sending a request with the user's credentials.

3. **Token Generation**: Upon successful login, the server generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) that encodes the user's information and permissions. This token is returned to the user.

4. **Token Usage**: The user includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header of subsequent API requests to access protected resources.

5. **Token Expiration**: Tokens have a limited lifespan for security reasons. Users must refresh their tokens or log in again once the token expires.

## API Endpoints for Authentication

### 1. User Registration
- **Endpoint**: `/users`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Creates a new user account.
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
        "username": "string",
        "password": "string",
        "email": "string"
    }
    ```
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
        "userId": "string",
        "message": "User created successfully."
    }
    ```

### 2. User Login
- **Endpoint**: `/auth/login`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Authenticates a user and returns an access token.
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
        "username": "string",
        "password": "string"
    }
    ```
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
        "accessToken": "string",
        "expiresIn": "number",
        "message": "Login successful."
    }
    ```

### 3. Token Refresh
- **Endpoint**: `/auth/refresh`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Description**: Refreshes the access token using a valid refresh token.
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
        "refreshToken": "string"
    }
    ```
- **Response**:
    ```json
    {
        "accessToken": "string",
        "expiresIn": "number",
        "message": "Token refreshed successfully."
    }
    ```

## Token Structure

The JWT consists of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.

- **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, including the type of token and the signing algorithm.
- **Payload**: Contains the claims, which are statements about the user and additional data (e.g., user ID, roles).
- **Signature**: Created by signing the header and payload with a secret key to ensure the token's integrity.

### Example of a JWT

```

```

## Security Considerations

- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect sensitive information.
- **Token Expiration**: Implement short-lived access tokens and use refresh tokens to enhance security.
- **Revocation**: Provide a mechanism to revoke tokens if a user logs out or if a security breach is suspected.

## Conclusion

The QuantumPay API employs a robust authentication mechanism to ensure secure access to its resources. By following the outlined authentication flow and best practices, developers can effectively integrate with the QuantumPay Network while maintaining security.
